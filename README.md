This repository contains the code for the first benchmark for evaluating the CB framework. The benchmark is based on the following paper: G. Hesse, C. Matthies and M. Uflacker, "How Fast Can We Insert? An Empirical Performance Evaluation of Apache Kafka," 2020 IEEE 26th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS), Hong Kong, 2020, pp. 641-648, doi: 10.1109/ICPADS51040.2020.00089.

The accompanying code (https://github.com/guenter-hesse/KafkaAnalysisTools)
was used as a basis for implementing the benchmark.
